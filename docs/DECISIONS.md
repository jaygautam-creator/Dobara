# Decision Log

Append-only. Newest at the bottom. **Never re-litigate an entry here without the user
explicitly overruling it.** Every session that makes a non-obvious choice appends to this.

Format: `## [DATE] — decision` / **Chose:** / **Over:** / **Because:**

---

## [2026-08-24] Track selection
**Chose:** Track 03 — AI Revenue Recovery.
**Over:** Track 02 (AI Risk Manager), Track 04 (Finance Controller).
**Because:** Track 02 is the crowded lane and has an unfixable data-provenance hole
(no public dispute datasets; synthesised labels would undermine the "honest metrics" bar
it is judged on). Track 03's metric is rupees, which is legible in one sentence; its data
problem is anchorable to published NPCI/RBI figures; and payment recovery is Razorpay's
most-sold capability.

## [2026-08-24] Loss class
**Chose:** Failed recurring mandate debits in India (UPI AutoPay / e-mandate / NACH / card).
**Over:** Checkout abandonment, B2B receivables, the full range in the brief.
**Because:** The brief lists a *range*; picking one point is required. This one is
batch-native, rupee-denominated, and regulation-rich.

## [2026-08-24] Objective function
**Chose:** Maximise expected **net LTV**: `P(success)·amount − P(revoke)·LTV_remaining − cost`.
**Over:** Maximise gross recovery / recovery rate.
**Because:** >20M UPI AutoPay mandates are revoked monthly over low balance, and Indian
regulation forces a customer notification before *every* retry — so attempts are causally
linked to revocation. Optimising gross recovery is value-destructive in this market.

## [2026-08-24] Evidence ladder — Tier 4 refused
**Chose:** Use declared preference, our own interaction history, and cohort priors.
**Over:** Modelling an individual customer's balance or cash-flow.
**Because:** Surveillance, and unnecessary. Also aligns with DPDP data minimisation. The
refusal is documented publicly — declining a capability you could have built is a stronger
signal than the feature would have been. Probing debits likewise refused.

## [2026-08-24] Language — Python, not Rust
**Chose:** Python 3.12 backend/ML, TypeScript frontend.
**Over:** Rust.
**Because:** The judged artifact is decision quality and measurement rigour, not
throughput; we have no performance constraint; no mature Rust equivalent of
LightGBM + isotonic calibration; on a 10-day solo budget Rust costs ~40% of the time for
zero judged points and makes the repo harder for a judge to run. Documented in
`03-TECH-STACK.md` including where Rust *would* be correct.

## [2026-08-24] Hosting — Vercel, not Cloudflare
**Chose:** Vercel (Fluid Compute, region `bom1`).
**Over:** Cloudflare Workers.
**Because:** Cloudflare's Python runtime is Pyodide-based and cannot load native wheels —
`lightgbm`/`scipy` will not run. Vercel runs real CPython with native deps up to 5 GB.
Decisive on that single fact. `bom1` also gives a correct data-residency posture given
RBI's localisation directive.

## [2026-08-24] Database — SQLite primary
**Chose:** SQLite locally (committed as a reproducible artifact), Neon Postgres free tier
for the deployed demo, one SQLAlchemy schema.
**Over:** Postgres everywhere.
**Because:** `git clone && make demo` with zero infrastructure is worth more than any
hosted feature for a repo-judged submission.

## [2026-08-24] LLM boundary
**Chose:** LLM for narrative, Hinglish nudge composition inside approved templates, and
audit Q&A. **Never** for probability estimation or the money decision. Enforced by import
boundary and a test.
**Because:** Money decisions must be calibrated and inspectable. Stating the boundary
explicitly is itself the signal that "AI Builder" is understood correctly.

## [2026-08-24] Regulatory ambiguity — conservative reading
**Chose:** Treat every retry as requiring its own 24-hour pre-debit notification
(`config.retry_requires_fresh_pdn = true`), and flag the ambiguity openly in the README.
**Over:** The convenient reading that the original cycle notification covers retries.
**Because:** Sources agree retries need a PDN and that retries skipping it are rejected
outright, but the in-cycle case is not crisply settled publicly. Choosing the stricter
side and documenting it is the instinct a payments company wants.
